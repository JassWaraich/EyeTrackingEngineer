Eye Tracking Application Overview:

This is a computer application designed in Python that uses the OpenCV Library to detect the eyes of the person using the Cam.
After the execution, it automatically directs user to the cam and detects the eyes indicated by rectangles.In future, I am planning
to extend it so that people with motor disabilities can interact with computer using their eye movements.

Instructions for Execution:

1. Copy all the source files into a directory.
2. Need to have a linux Environment.If not, download latest version of Ubuntu from https://www.ubuntu.com/download
3. Open the terminal, Go to the directory where Source files are kept.
4. Run the command chmod a+x video_traking_eydetection.py to change the file permission executable.
5. Execute the file using ./video_traking_eydetection.py
6. It will automactically open the cam and will detect the eyes.
7. Hit Ctrl+Z to exit or kill the processs.
